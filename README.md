## Background

Rhinoviruses (RV), common respiratory pathogens, are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses characterized by a high antigenic diversity and mutation rate. With their genome approximately 7.2 kb in length, RVs exhibit mutation rates between 10^-3 and 10^-5 mutations per nucleotide per replication event. These viruses are classified into 169 types across three species: RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C. Genotype assignment, a critical aspect of RV research, is based on pairwise genetic distances and phylogenetic clustering with prototype strains, a process currently executed manually and laboriously. 

## Test-Data 
The project will utilize VP4/2 sequences available in the public domain from GenBank and reference prototype strains from www.picornaviridae.com  

## Package
Our project aims to develop an R package to automate RV genotype assignment, facilitating genomic scientists in efficiently genotyping RV infections.

Our methodology involves:
1. Parsing and preprocessing of VP4/2 sequence data.
2. Implementation of algorithms to calculate pairwise genetic distances.
3. Integration of methods for constructing Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic 
trees.
