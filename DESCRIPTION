Description: By  automating  the  comparison  of  sequence  data  against 
    prototype  strains  and  implementing  predefined  pairwise distance  thresholds,  "rhinotypeR"  aims  to  streamline  the 
    genotype  assignment  process,  making  it  accessible  to 
    researchers  and  public  health  professionals  alike.  This  tool 
    represents  a  significant  step  forward  in  the  quest  to  enhance 
    our  epidemiological  toolkit,  enabling  more  efficient 
    surveillance  and  analysis  of  RVs  and  potentially  other  viral 
    pathogens with complex genomic landscapes.
