Technical steps:

a) Task 1 -- curate the reference sequences: format of the sequence headers, align, genotype labelling
b) Task 2 -- Function to read the reference sequences and query sequence
c) Task 3 (and very key!) -- a function calculating pairwise distances in R. Starting with just 2 sequences: a query and a reference. Will optimize for memory and multiple sequences/ queries after.
